# Introduction

This is the nix flake config for managing my git development 
environment on my M2 macbook air.

The goal is to automatically activate the Nix shell defined in
`flake.nix`, once you navigate into `$HOME/git` and to specific
subfolders.

- [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)
  is set up via home-manager.

```sh
# in `$HOME/.config/home-manager/home.nix`
  programs.direnv = {
    enable = true;
    nix-direnv.enable = true;
    enableZshIntegration = true;
  };
```

The file `.envrc` makes `nix-direnv` use flakes.

```sh
# in ./.envrc
use flake .
```

To build and activate the nix shell environment, execute

```sh
cd $HOME/git
direnv activate
# navigate to any subfolders and activate
# to revoke
# direnv disallow
```

# Current Nix environment

```sh
#| eval: true
cat flake.nix
```
